Project Overview
The Walmart Customer Segmentation Analysis project analyzes customer data to create meaningful segments based on purchase behavior and demographics. The key steps in the analysis include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing the distribution of key variables such as Gender, Age, and Purchase.

Segmentation: Applying KMeans clustering to categorize customers into distinct groups.

Insights and Recommendations: Providing actionable insights for targeted marketing, product strategies, and customer service improvements.

Installation Instructions
To run this project locally:

Clone the repository:
