## Project Overview

The Walmart Customer Segmentation Analysis project analyzes customer data to create meaningful segments based on purchase behavior and demographics. The key steps in the analysis include:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing the distribution of key variables (e.g., Gender, Age, Purchase).
3. **Segmentation**: Applying **KMeans clustering** to categorize customers into distinct groups.
4. **Insights & Recommendations**: Based on the segmentation, actionable insights are provided for targeted marketing, product strategies, and more.

## Installation Instructions

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone this repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/walmart-customer-segmentation.git
    ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
    - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed.
    - Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        ```
    - Activate the virtual environment:
        - On Windows:
            ```bash
            venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
        - On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
    - Install the required libraries:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## Usage

1. **Load the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the `Walmart_CustomerSegmentationAnalysis.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Run all cells** to perform data preprocessing, EDA, clustering, and segmentation.
3. **Analyze the results**: Visualizations and insights will help inform marketing and product strategies based on customer segments.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run this project:

- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms (e.g., KMeans clustering).
- `matplotlib`: For creating static plots.

Install them via `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can generate the `requirements.txt` file with:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
